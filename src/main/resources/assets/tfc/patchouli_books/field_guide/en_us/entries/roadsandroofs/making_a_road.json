Crushed base course can be crafted with gravel, loose rocks, and a hammer, and can be applied to tamped blocks via right-clicking. This base course of crushed rocks creates a sturdy base for the final walking surface to rest upon."

Different items, including bricks, hoggin, and loose rocks can be applied via right-clicking on top of a base course to form a walkable road.

For more details on different types of road, refer to their respective pages in this manual."
